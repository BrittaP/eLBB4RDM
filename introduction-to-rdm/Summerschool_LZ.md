# Summerschool

# Gute wissenschaftliche Praxis / good research practice

## Introduction
As a warm-up, an introductory question on the topic of good research practice.

-----

For his first research project at university, Tim wants to find out how to follow the principles of responsible research and what he needs to consider. To follow good research practices, Tim should ...

    [[ ]] proceed on the basis of what he has learned at school.
    [[X]] look into the university's guidelines for good research practices.
    [[ ]] look for examples in the press.
    [[ ]] just start working and learn as he goes.


Tim's decision is in line with good research practice because ...

    [[ ]] everyone does it this way.
    [[ ]] Research is creative and should not be constrained by rules.
    [[ ]] it saves valuable resources.
    [[X]] it ensures reliable research results.

-----

Have you been confident in the choice of a practice and in the justification? Do you see another justification as the right one? The warm-up question is not about the answer being universally valid for ever, but about the current understanding within the scientific community. This can, of course, change over time, so consider the "correct" rationale we provide as an offer of discussion and reflection of your own perspective.

## Guidelines and Codes like DFG and ALLEA

Guidelines and codes using the example of the DFG and ALLEA
There are various interdisciplinary codes that have a certain binding force in the European area and are often considered and used - for example as the basis for research proposals.

The most well-known are:

![ECoC](/fdm-module/Gute_wissenschaftliche_Praxis/images/logo_ecoc_2017.png)<!--  width="140px" align="right"
-->

>* ALLEA: [European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (2017)](http://www.allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ALLEA-European-Code-of-Conduct-for-Research-Integrity-2017-1.pdf)


![DFG](/fdm-module/Gute_wissenschaftliche_Praxis/images/logo_dfg_2019.png)<!--  width="140px" align="right"
-->

>* DFG: [Leitlinien zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis (2022)](https://zenodo.org/record/6472827#.ZC5r_HvP25c)

-----

In addition to interdisciplinary codes, there are often guidelines of individual institutions as well as subject-specific guidelines.

-----

## Task

>Investigate whether there is a policy or code from the CAU. Search for a policy or code for your discipline / from your institution.

Were you able to find one or more guidelines? Save the link or the file to be able to refer to it at any time.

-----

## GRP & RDM

No one likes to refer to other people's data or texts and then find out afterwards that data there has been falsified or plagiarised. So if we want to make sure that our research results are reliable, this means for our own work that we should meet the requirements of good research practice. Knowing and adhering to such rules also helps to improve the quality of one's own work.

-----

Guidelines can be used for different purposes.

>* They serve as orientation in the research process
>
>* They help to ensure compliance with good research practice
>
>* They are a means of quality assurance
>
>* They help to be able to assess the research projects of others
>
>* They provide the framework within which research should be conducted
>
>* But they also set the boundaries for when something is questionable research or misconduct.

"Indigenous data must facilitate **collective benefit** for Indigenous Peoples to achieve inclusive development and innovation, improve governance and citizen engagement, and realize equitable outcomes. Benefits accrue when data ecosystems are designed and function to support (1) Indigenous nation and community use and reuse of data; (2) use of data for policy decisions and evaluation of services; and (3) creation and use of data that reflect community values.

UNDRIP affirms Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in their data. Recognition of these rights bolsters Indigenous Peoples’ **authority to control** and govern such data, further affirming the need for ‘data for governance.’ Indigenous Peoples must have access to data that support Indigenous governance and self-determination. Indigenous Peoples must be the ones to determine data governance protocols, while being actively involved in stewardship decisions for Indigenous data that are held by other entities.

When working with Indigenous data, there is a **responsibility** to nurture respectful relationships with Indigenous Peoples from whom the data originate. Aspects of the relationship include investing in capacity development, increasing community data capabilities, and embedding data within Indigenous languages and cultures. Pursuing these goals fulfills the ultimate responsibility of supporting Indigenous data that advances Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit.

Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the focus across data ecosystems and throughout data lifecycles in order to minimize harm, maximize benefits, promote justice, and allow for future use. Paramount to **ethics** in data practices is representation and participation of Indigenous Peoples, who must be the ones to assess benefits, harms, and potential future uses based on community values and ethics."

# Integrity and Ethics

## Introduction

Ahmed has observed that his colleague Susie is falsifying data in a research project. He wants to comply with good research practice and informs the ...

    [[X]] Ombudspersons.
    [[ ]] Ethics Committee.
    [[ ]] Police.
    [[ ]] Department of Public Information.

********************************************************************************
Good research practice requires that there is a working/research environment that makes it possible. In addition to guidelines and codes, these are structures that support compliance with the guidelines. The general research environment provided by the research facility/institution includes in particular the areas of integrity and ethics.

(An overview of the structures of integrity and ethics at the CAU can be found  [here](https://www.uni-kiel.de/de/forschung/integritaet-ethik).)

## Ethics committee

>"Ethics committee - aren't those the ones who check whether medical research projects and animal experiments are permissible?"

-----

Most people have probably heard of the Ethics Committee. The ethics committee at the CAU is divided into two parts: one for the Faculty of Medicine and one for the other departments.

>[allgemeine Ethikkommission der CAU](https://www.uni-kiel.de/gf-praesidium/de/ethikkommission-der-cau)
>
>[Ethikkommission der Medizinischen Fakultät](https://www.medizin.uni-kiel.de/de/fakultaet/ethik-kommission)

-----

**What does the ethics committee do:** The ethics committee is not only relevant for research in the field of medicine, but also for all other disciplines in which research in connection with living beings takes place. This also applies to the fields of biology, chemistry, psychology, education and many others. If you want to conduct research on a topic, it is worth taking a look at the homepage of the Ethics Committee ~~before~~ you realise the research project.

Die Ethikkommission an der CAU arbeitet auf Grundlage der [Satzung der CAU zu "Forschungsfreiheit und Forschungsrisiken"](https://www.uni-kiel.de/fileadmin/user_upload/forschung/integritaet-ethik/downloads/CAU-Satzung_zum_Umgang_mit_Forschungsrisiken.pdf). Sie setzt sich aus Mitgliedern verschiedener Fakultäten zusammen, haben drei feste Mitglieder und vier Stellvertreter:innen.

-----

## Ombudsteam

Ombudsteam - never heard of it? Unfortunately, that happens quite often. The ombudsteam is always the right contact when it comes to (suspected) research misconduct.

[Ombudsteam der CAU](https://www.uni-kiel.de/de/forschung/integritaet-ethik)

**What does the ombudsteam do:** The ombudsteam is available to members and affiliates of CAU for questions relating to good research practice. They investigate suspected cases of misconduct.

-----

>"Higher education institutions and non-university research institutions shall provide at least one independent ombudsperson to whom their members and staff may turn in matters of good research practice and suspected research misconduct. They shall take sufficient care to ensure that the ombudspersons are known at the institution. A substitute shall be provided for each ombudsperson in case of concern of bias or prevention." (DFG 2019, S. 12f.)(translated by deepL)


## Differentiation between Ethics committee and Ombudsteam

********************************************************************************
Work together in groups of 3-4 people und display differences between ethics committee and ombudsteam. Feel free and be creative in how you are doing so.

You have 15 Minutes for this task. Please present your results afterwards to the whole group.

********************************************************************************
Both the ethics committee and the ombudsteam team are there to ensure good research practice. However, they perform different tasks in the research process. While the ethics committee weighs up the risks in particular in the run-up to research, the ombudsman team is usually only active during the research - i.e. when something has gone wrong.

### Aufgabe

>Stellen Sie sich vor, Sie führen zusammen mit einer weiteren Personen ein Forschungsprojekt / eine Seminararbeit durch und haben Daten erhoben, die Sie zunächst getrennt voneinander aufbereiten um die Analyse gemeinsam durchzuführen. Dabei fällt Ihnen auf, dass die Daten der anderen Person weniger Schwankungen enthalten, als Ihre eigenen. Sie bekommen die Rohdaten zur Gegenprüfung trotz Nachfrage jedoch nicht.
>
>Führen Sie das Szenario weiter und schreiben ein paar Zeilen, wie Sie nun weiter vorgehen würden.

Wo sehen Sie Schwierigkeiten? 

Welche Probleme können auftreten? 

Wie würden Sie damit umgehen?
